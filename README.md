âœ¨ Hi! Iâ€™m a current fourth year student at UCSD pursuing a B.S. degree in Data Science and minor in Business Analytics with a concentration in supply chain management. My primary interests are in the areas of data analysis, statistics, and finance and business management. I'm just entering the job market, but I'm really excited to learn new things while working with so many other passionate teammates!


- ðŸ”­ I've been practicing Python machine learning modeling using scikit-learn and visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning SQL and Front-End development (UI/UX research seems intriguing)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m hoping to land a data science, data analyst, or business analyst internship/job

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love bouldering or reading webtoons in my free time!
